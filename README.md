## Summary of my key ML projects, with links

### UCL MSc Machine Learning 2021-22 

#### MSc Thesis: *Learning directed acyclic graphs by backpropagation*

Developed a framework for learning directed acyclic graphs via discrete backpropagation, testing it on synthetic and real data, with competitive results which proved the concept.

I learnt about discrete backpropagation techniques and about combinatoric & continuous DAG-finding algorithms. I also learnt about defining and organising a project of this nature and scale in a short time period.

#### MSc Statistical Natural Language Processing group project: *Learning from clue structure to solve cryptic crosswords*

Originated and coded structural ideas we used for our solver.  This enabled us to get very close to state-of-the-art mid-size transformer performance – with only a relatively small dataset.  Outstanding Distinction.

I learnt about working in a team of peers, working together to steer and develop a project on a very short timescale.  I also learnt about cryptic crosswords and how they are structured.

### Personal projects:

#### NLearn

Used Reinforcement Learning to get two agents to “invent” a language to communicate a very simple numerical message successfully.  I then developed NLearnMulti, which sought to do the same with many agents talking over each other on a graph – and found it was much harder to get agents to clearly understand messages in that context.

I learnt how to define and optimise a multi-agent reinforcement learning, and how to manage multiple experiments.

#### Quasar mass machine learning

Processed astrophysical data and built a neural net to predict the mass of supermassive black holes from their “quasar” emissions.  Within the distribution of quasars I was targeting, this achieved predictions to within current observational estimates.

I learnt how to shape complex data for machine learning and set up a simple model.  I also learnt how difficult it can be to extend to "out-of-distribution" data.
