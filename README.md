### UCL MSc Machine Learning 2021-22 

#### MSc Thesis: *Learning directed acyclic graphs by backpropagation*

Developed a framework for learning directed acyclic graphs via discrete backpropagation, testing it on synthetic and real data.

I learnt about discrete backpropagation techniques, and about defining and organising a project of this nature and scale in a short time period.
